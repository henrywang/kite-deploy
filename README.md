# kite-deploy

kite-deploy is one of sub-projects of kite, which is to run Linux application or kernel test on all kinds of public and private cloud platform.

kite-deploy will provide an easy way to setup Linux guest/instance/VM, build and maintain Linux image on public and private cloud platform.

## kite-deploy Roles

kite-deploy includes two roles to have different jobs done. You can group them together into ansible playbook to finish your work.

    guest     Create guest/instance/VM in different cloud platform
    image     Build image for different cloud platform

## deploy instance/VM on cloud

### deploy AWS EC2 instance

    ansible-playbook -v -i inventory -e cloud_platform=aws deploy.yaml

### deploy VMWare ESXi VM

    ansible-playbook -v -i inventory -e esxi_firmware=<bios or efi> -e cloud_platform=esxi deploy.yaml

## remove instance/VM on cloud

### remove AWS EC2 instance

    ansible-playbook -v -i inventory -e cloud_platform=aws remove.yaml

### remove VMWare ESXi VM

    ansible-playbook -v -i inventory -e cloud_platform=esxi remove.yaml

## kite-deploy Image

kite-deploy will build/update images for different cloud platforms weekly.

**Images kite-deploy build and maintain**

| Cloud Platform / Linux Distro | Image Info |
| ---- | ---- |
| VMWare ESXi 7.0 / RHEL 8.3 | vSphere template `template-rhel-8-3-bios` and `template-rhel-8-3-efi` |
| AWS EC2 AMI / RHEL 8.3 | Region `US East (N. Virginia)` AMI ID is stored in Amazon Simple Systems Manager parameter with parameter name `kite_imagebuild_rhel-8-3` |

Image building [kickstart files](https://github.com/henrywang/lctp/tree/master/roles/image/templates) are for [LTP](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp) test running. If you need more packages according to your test, feel free to send PR to [kickstart files](https://github.com/henrywang/lctp/tree/master/roles/image/templates).

### Image Building

Build ESXi image with:

    ansible-playbook -v -i inventory -e esxi_firmware=<bios or efi> -e cloud_platform=esxi build.yml

Build AWS EC2 AMI image with:

    ansible-playbook -v -i inventory -e cloud_platform=aws build.yml
